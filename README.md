# InterviewPrep

This is just a repository for practice implementing various algorithms that will be useful for to know for interviews.  Many times I understand how an algorithm works on a very high level, however if asked to implement it (say on a whiteboard), I will struggle.  Hopefully through working through these enough, I will be able to nail my implementation skills.
